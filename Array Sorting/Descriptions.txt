SORTING:
Write a function that sorts an array of numbers so that the first element is the biggest one, the second is the smallest one, the third is the second biggest one, and the fourth is the second smallest one, and so on. 
Print the elements on one row, separated by a single space.

Input					Output
[1, 21, 3, 52, 69, 63, 31, 2, 18, 94]	94 1 69 2 63 3 52 18 31 21
[34, 2, 32, 45, 690, 6, 32, 7, 19, 47]	690 2 47 6 45 7 34 19 32 32



SORTING BY TWO:
Write a function that orders an array of strings, by their length in ascending order as primary criteria, and by alphabetical value in ascending order as second criteria. The comparison should be case-insensitive.
The input comes as an array of strings.
The output is the ordered array of strings, each on a separate line.
