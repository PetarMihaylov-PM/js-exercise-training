Pesho is a pro gladiator, he is struggling to become master of the Arena. 
You will receive several input lines in one of the following formats:
"{gladiator} -> {technique} -> {skill}"
"{gladiator} vs {gladiator}"
The gladiator and technique are strings, the given skill will be an integer number. You need to keep track of every gladiator. 
When you receive a gladiator and his technique and skill, add him to the gladiator pool, if he isn't present, else add his technique or update his skill, only if the current technical skill is lower than the new value.
If you receive "{gladiator} vs {gladiator}" and both gladiators exist in the tier, they duel with the following rules:
Compare their techniques, if they got at least one in common, the gladiator with better total skill points wins and the other is demoted from the tier -> remove him.
If they don't have techniques in common, the duel isn't happening and both continue in the Season.
You should end your program when you receive the command "Ave Cesar". At that point, you should print the gladiators, ordered by total skill in descending order, then ordered by name in ascending order. Foreach gladiator prints their technique and skill ordered descending, then ordered by technique name in ascending order.
