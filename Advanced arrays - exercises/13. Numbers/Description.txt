You are given numbers in a sequence on a single line, separated by a space. After that, you will receive commands that modify the sequence differently: 
•	"Add {value}" - you should add the given value to the end of the sequence.
•	"Remove {value}" - you should remove the first occurrence of the given value if there is such.
•	"Replace {value} {replacement}" - you should replace the first occurrence of the given value with the replacement if there is such occurrence.
•	"Collapse {value}" you must remove each number with a value less than the given one.
When you receive the command "Finish", you should print the modified sequence and end the program.
Input / Constraints
•	On the first line, you will receive a sequence with numbers, separated by spaces - integers in the range 
[-1000…1000].
•	On the following lines, you will receive commands until the "Finish" command is received.
•	The commands will always be valid.
Output
•	Print a single line the array of numbers separated by a space, with the modified values.

The input will be provided as an array of strings.
