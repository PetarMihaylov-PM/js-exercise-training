Write a function that receives an array of integers and an array of string commands and executes them over the array. The commands are as follows:
•	add <index> <element> – adds element at the specified index (elements right from this position inclusively are shifted to the right).
•	addMany <index><element 1> <element 2> … <element n> – adds a set of elements at the specified index.
•	contains <element> – prints the index of the first occurrence of the specified element (if exists) in the array or -1 if the element is not found.
•	remove <index> – removes the element at the specified index.
•	shift <positions> – shifts every element of the array the number of positions to the left (with rotation).
o	For example, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] -> shift 2 -> [3, 4, 5, 1, 2]
•	sumPairs – sums the elements in the array by pairs (first + second, third + fourth, …).
o	For example, [1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] -> [3, 9, 13, 8].
•	print – stop receiving more commands and print the last state of the array in the following format:
         `[ {element1}, {element2}, …elementN} ]`
  Note: The elements in the array must be joined by comma and space (, ).


Examples
Input										Output
[1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7],
['add 1 8', 'contains 1', 'contains 3', 'print']				0
										-1
										[ 1, 8, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7 ]
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
['addMany 5 9 8 7 6 5', 'contains 15', 'remove 3', 'shift 1', 'print']		
										-1
										[ 2, 3, 5, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 1 ]
