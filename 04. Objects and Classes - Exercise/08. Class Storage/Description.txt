Create a class Storage. It should have the following properties, while the constructor should only receive a capacity:
•	capacity – a number that decreases when adding a given quantity of products to storage
•	storage – list of products (object). Each product should have:
o	name - a string
o	price – a number (price is for a single piece of product)
o	quantity – a number
•	totalCost – the sum of the cost of the products
The class should also have the following methods:
•	addProduct – a function that receives a product and adds it to the storage
•	getProcuts – a function that returns all the products in storage in JSON format, each on a new line
Paste only the class Storage in judge (Note: all names should be as described)
Example
Test your Storage class.
