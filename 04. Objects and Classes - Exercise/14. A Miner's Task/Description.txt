You are given an array of strings. Every odd string is representing a resource (e.g. Gold, Silver, Copper, and so on), and every even – quantity. Your task is to collect the resources and print them each on a new line. 
Print the resources and their quantities in the format:
{resource} –> {quantity}
The quantities inputs will be in the range [1 … 2 000 000 000].
