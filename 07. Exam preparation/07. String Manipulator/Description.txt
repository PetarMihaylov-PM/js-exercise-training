Create a program that executes changes over a string. First, you are going to receive the string, then commands.
You will be receiving commands until the "End" command. There are six possible commands:
•	"Translate {char} {replacement}"
o	Replace all occurrences of the given char with the given replacement, then print the string.
•	"Includes {substring}"
o	Check if the current string includes the given substring and print "True" or "False".
•	"Start {substring}"
o	Check if the current string starts with the given substring and print "True" or "False".
•	"Lowercase"
o	Make the whole string lowercased, then print it.
•	"FindIndex {char}"
o	Find the index of the last occurrence of the given char, then print it.
•	"Remove {startIndex} {count}"
o	Remove the given count of characters from the string, starting from the start index, then print it.
Input
•	On the first line, you are going to receive the string.
•	On the following lines, until the "End" command is received, you will be receiving commands.
•	All commands are case-sensitive.
•	The input will always be valid.
Output
•	Print the output of every command in the format described above.
JS Examples
The input will be provided as an array of strings.
