# JavaScript Exercises ðŸ˜¤

This repository contains a collection of simple web applications and coding exercises that Iâ€™ve built to practice and improve my skills in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Each exercise focuses on different concepts, helping me learn fundamental programming techniques and apply them in real-world scenarios. ðŸ“•

## Whatâ€™s Inside ðŸ™„
- **JavaScript exercises** covering topics such as loops, functions, DOM manipulation, and more.
- **HTML and CSS** used for structuring and styling the web applications.
- Each project is self-contained and includes instructions for setup and usage.
